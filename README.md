# Library for enumerating cuts
This repository will implement various algorithms for enumerating cuts in graphs. The goal of this library is an efficient way of exploring the chemical molecule space by treating their structures as graphs.

This repository is the result of a software project for the module "Fortgeschrittene Methoden der Bioinformatik" at the University of Leipzig.
